	libusb-1.0-devel, note: this is NOT libusb which comes with most distros
    libxml2-dev
    build-essential
    For example: "sudo apt install libusb-1.0-devel"

After installing the above library or locating it (usually in /lib /usr/lib
or /usr/local/lib) adjust the prefix in the Makefile to point to the
location on your system
	prefix=/usr/local

or wherever libusb-1.0 is

after that type
	sudo make install
and the application 
	gcdcTool
should be created.


How to know that gcdcTool has been successfully installed

Plug in a device 

type (probably as root)
        gcdcTool --settime
then
        gcdcTool --gettime

Both should return without error.  The gettime command should return a
string something like this

RTC Raw Time: 0x55, 21, 15, 00, 18, 87, 09, 88, 00, 0b, 7f, 08, 80, 3f,
00, 08, 00, 1a, 40, 
 which is the raw time of day from the real time clock.

Once you have the gcdcTool tested on your system (reads and writes time
of day) you should be able to upload new firmware into the units.  

The exact syntax for uploading the firmware is
        gcdcTool --update somename.hex 

The upload takes less than 30 sec to complete.  Once the unit has been
updated the blue Led should start blinking again.  

IMPORTANT!  Wait for the file system to finish interacting with the unit
before attempting the upgrade (about 15sec after being mounted).  If
there is file system activity with the unit while doing an upgrade, the
upgrade will probably fail, and you'll have to send it back here to be
reprogrammed.

Also after running the update, the version number can be read with this
line
        /sbin/lsusb -v 2>/dev/null | grep -i X6

should return
 iProduct                2 GCDC X6 rev:xxx


where xxx is the subversion control number
